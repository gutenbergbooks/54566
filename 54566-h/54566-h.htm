<h2 id="c1"><span class="small">PREFACE</span></h2>
<p>This popular field guide to Castle Neck, Ipswich, Massachusetts, was the inspiration
of Mr. Cornelius Crane, who has summered there since boyhood. Two
years ago, Mr. Crane asked us if we would be willing to undertake a survey of
this typical dune area if funds were made available for the study. We were
delighted to cooperate in the project, and our Education Department undertook
it with real enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Some preliminary work was done in 1957, but during July, August, and
part of September, 1958, Laurence B. White, Jr., of our Education staff, and
Geoffrey Moran, his assistant, moved to Castle Neck. It is Larry who has
compiled this field guide.</p>
<p>Larry has been associated with our Museum since his Junior High School
days, when his consuming interest in natural history made him an almost daily
visitor, and later a valued Education Department volunteer. Now, after his
graduation from the University of New Hampshire, where he majored in Biology
and Education, he has joined our permanent staff. I recount this only to point
out that this study was undertaken by a born and bred New England naturalist
who enjoyed every minute of his work on it.</p>
<p>Finding a little cottage on the side of a marsh on the road to Little Neck,
Larry and Jeff took it over as their combined summer residence and laboratory,
and spent the July and August weeks in Thoreau-like exploration of the beach
and dunes, the swamps and woodlands of Castle Neck. Their personal relationship
with the living things on the Neck is feelingly reflected in this guide:
sympathy with the heroic struggle for survival on the dunes; admiration for
the hardihood of the little-admired Poison Ivy; amusement with the odd ways
of the Common Barnacle, which &ldquo;goes through life standing on its head and
kicking food into its mouth with its feet&rdquo;; and exasperation with the mischievous
practice of noisy Crows, who delight in wrecking an Owl&rsquo;s daytime sleep.</p>
<p>It is perhaps because of this perceptive quality of understanding that
Larry&rsquo;s report of the survey has readily adapted into a popular field guide,
directing the curious into a fascinating exploration of the &ldquo;heap o&rsquo; living&rdquo; going
on under our very noses and all but ignored by most of us. This guide is not
intended as an exhaustive research work or a listing of all the living things to
be found on Castle Neck. Rather, it purposely addresses itself to natural
history readily observable by visitors with sharp eyes and reasonable patience.
When a rarity is included like the Ipswich Sparrow, it is only to indicate that
such unusual thrills await the discoverer&mdash;occasionally!</p>

<p>While this guide serves as a reminder to those engaged in the study of
ecology that this is a rich area for serious investigation, the amateur naturalist
or the casual beach visitor, primarily on hand to sun, swim, or picnic, may use
it to make his stop on the Neck more meaningful. Knowing, for instance, that
Hog Island is a drumlin (a pile of debris deposited in the Great Ice Age) adds
enormous interest to the surroundings. Larry&rsquo;s guide is compiled with the
understanding eye and heart of an able and enthusiastic young naturalist. It
invites you to look over his shoulder as he investigates his finds, and tempts
you to further exploration on your own.</p>
<p>The analysis of the infinitely complex relationships of living animals and
plants to their environment, and to one another, is a relatively new science.
People with a strong desire to know more about the great sea of life surrounding
them have a real opportunity to contribute valuable observations to ecological
knowledge. You may very well be one of these!</p>

<br />THE SHIFTING DUNES</h2>
<p>Surprising as it may seem, there was a time when many of our most beautiful
beaches, the Castle Neck area included, were far inland from the edge of the
sea. This was about a million and a half years ago, when the sea was at a lower
level than it is today. In fact, a great many changes have helped to form the
beaches we see and enjoy now. Of them all, the one brought about by the
Ice Age was probably the most influential. It was some 30,000 or 40,000 years
ago that New England was overwhelmed by the final advance of a great continental
ice sheet. It came from the northwest, and as it inched its way toward
the ocean it pushed chunks of rock and great quantities of soil along with it.
The rock was continually breaking up as it was shoved forward under the ice.</p>
<p>This last glacier covered New England for thousands of years. When it
melted, all the debris it had been moving along like a giant bulldozer was left
deposited irregularly over the land, some debris perhaps a hundred miles from
original location. In addition, the water from the melting ice swept finer sands
and gravels along, depositing them over land areas and in lakes and bays.</p>
<p>In some places, streamlined hills of debris had been built up under the ice.
Later, as the ice melted, they became exposed. They were shaped like the
bowl of an inverted spoon, and we call them &ldquo;drumlins.&rdquo; Hog Island, to the
south of Castle Neck, is a perfectly preserved example. From its shape it is
easy to tell which way the ice was moving. The steeply sloping end of its long
axis is toward the northwest, the direction from which the last ice sheet came.
All drumlins are not so easily spotted. About a mile southeast of Castle Hill
you will see a hill that looks like an enormous sand dune. It is the highest
point on the Neck, about eighty feet, and it, too, is a drumlin. Once it protruded
out of a shallow bay that had formed as the ice melted. Modified by
the erosion of the waves and veneered with windblown sand, this drumlin by
now has quite lost its characteristic shape.</p>
<p>In the general Boston area many drumlins were uncovered as the ice
melted; some of them are such well-known landmarks as Beacon Hill, Bunker
Hill, or Breed&rsquo;s Hill. Along the coast, as the sea level rose, the drumlins there
were surrounded by water and became islands. On the sides exposed to the
sea they were eroded by the waves, and the eroded materials collected to form
spits. Other sands and gravels carried by longshore currents were added, and, by-and-by,
in some cases these sand spits connected one drumlin to another. It was
just such a modification of three separate drumlins that formed Castle Neck.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">2</div>
<p>While the Neck was thus taking shape, the glacial debris and outwash
sands that had been deposited in New Hampshire and at the mouth of the
Merrimack River were being picked up and carried southward by the prevailing
currents. Finally this material was wave-tossed onto the newly created
beach at Castle Neck, some of it being lifted and carried farther inland. In this
way, except for a few protected spots behind the drumlins, the entire area
became blanketed with sand. The shape of the Beach as we see it is the result
of this ever-continuing modification, the work of wind and waves.</p>
<p>It was on the protected back side of the drumlins that plants first took
hold. Since the drumlins were formed from fertile soil scraped from rich inland
areas and carried here by the ice, the same kinds of plants sprang up on them&mdash;Aspens,
Pines, Gray Birches, shrubs, and grasses&mdash;as we often see today taking
over some abandoned farmland. As these early plants died, the soil was
further enriched to stimulate even more and different plant life. In fact, at
one time much of the dune area was a fertile spot, abounding with all sorts of
plants and animals. In certain places on the Neck today, very fertile soil can
be found just a few feet under the sand, evidence that here was once a rich
farmland.</p>
<p>The broad flat areas of sand on the Beach were very susceptible to the
whims of the wind. Now and then, as the wind eroded the sand particles from
one place, and blew them to another, it piled them up against the base of some
beach plant. Collecting here, the sand began to form a gentle slope with a
sharp drop-off downwind. Continuation of this action sometimes built up a
huge mound, which we call a dune.</p>
<p>This process of erosion and deposition still goes on. Usually you can tell
the general direction of the prevailing wind by observing which way it builds
the gentle slope as it piles the sand into ripples or mounds.</p>
<p>If you should mark a dune&rsquo;s position today and return in several years,
you might find that the dune had moved several yards from its original position.
Dunes move slowly downwind, such movement being termed &ldquo;migration.&rdquo;
With a normal dune, during windy periods the sand is blown up its gentle slope
and dropped over its crest, whence it slides down the lee side. In this way the
dune migrates with the wind.</p>
<h3>THE FUTURE OF CASTLE NECK</h3>
<p>Eventually, of course, the dunes might migrate the entire length of the
Neck and again be blown into the sea, which would carry the sands farther
south, mayhap to become part of Coffin and Wingaersheek Beaches. In fact,
we might expect the eventual removal of the entire Neck if sand wasn&rsquo;t constantly
being added from similar erosion going on farther north. Obviously
there is a very delicate balance here, adding and subtracting sand. The future
of Castle Neck is entirely dependent upon the sand supply from the north. Too
little may eventually diminish Crane&rsquo;s Beach; while an increase could create
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
an even larger and more beautiful Neck. Actually, it is impossible to predict
the future of a beach, at the mercy, as it is, of changes in any of the several
factors controlling its form&mdash;sand supply, waves, currents, and position of
sea level. Anyway, what has been so long taking shape will not be altered
drastically overnight. As a matter of fact, if you really wish to know the
future of Crane&rsquo;s Beach, you will have to be patient. Another million and a
half years will probably tell the story!</p>
<h3>GEOLOGICAL DISCOVERIES YOU CAN MAKE</h3>
<h4><i>Ventifacts</i></h4>
<p>These small, faceted pebbles found in the dunes have been blasted by
the windblown sand. They show the powerful abrasive action of the wind.
Most of those you will find here were faceted just after they had been deposited
by retreating glacial ice. A migrating dune or a blowout in the sand has left
them uncovered.</p>
<h4><i>Erratics</i></h4>
<p>Large rocks occasionally found in the dunes are called &ldquo;erratics.&rdquo; In this
world of tiny particles they appear very much out of place, but they were carried
here by the glacier a million years ago. They have been uncovered by the migration
of some dune.</p>
<h4><i>Fulgurites</i></h4>
<p>Occasionally lightning strikes the sand, fusing it into a little tube or ball
of glass. These fulgurites have been found here but are very rare and a real
&ldquo;discovery.&rdquo;</p>
<h4><i>Glacial Till</i></h4>
<p>The original soil deposited by the glacier may be seen by digging into the
sand at the drumlin. Such rocky soil is quite surprising to people who think the
beach is nothing but a big &ldquo;sand pile.&rdquo;</p>
<h4><i>Garnets</i></h4>
<p>Examine a handful of sand. You will find that it consists of light-colored
particles (mostly Quartz) and of black particles. Under a microscope many of
these dark particles look like little gems. They are actually a deep red and are
true Garnets. Large Garnets are used as gem stones, small ones for sandpaper&mdash;further
proof of the abrasive ability of windblown sand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<h4><i>History in the Sand</i></h4>
<p>In your handful of sand you may find particles that are neither Quartz nor
Garnet. Minerals such as Feldspar, Biotite, Mica, Magnetite, Hornblende, and
others can be identified by the geologist and are a clue to the original type of
rock over which the glacier moved.</p>
<h4><i>Beach Porcupines</i></h4>
<p>These are hard-packed balls of twigs and grasses. Loose vegetable matter
is very light and may be blown along by the wind for many miles. As it goes
it adds other vegetation to itself, until packed into a very tight, hard ball. It
may also get its start in the water by being whirled into a tiny ball; and later
it is thrown onto the beach, to begin rolling along. A most curious souvenir!</p>

<br />AN INTRODUCTION TO DUNE ECOLOGY</h2>
<p>Living things cover the face of the earth from the torrid sands of the desert to
the cold wastes of the Arctic, and every variation in environment develops a
closely knit community of plants and animals. They are the ones best adapted
to living where they do, or they may have been the first to arrive there, filling
all available homesites and monopolizing the food and water supply to create a
&ldquo;closed&rdquo; community. In each environment, a delicate balance is established
between its various residents and between them and their surroundings. The
study of all these interrelationships is called &ldquo;ecology.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beginning with the environment, we have seen in our brief look at the
origins of Castle Neck how drastically an area can be altered as conditions
change on the earth&rsquo;s surface. Environment is affected in other ways, too.
Man&rsquo;s activity can change it almost overnight as a bulldozer clears land for a
housing development, a dam alters the flow or course of a river, or careless
disposal of a cigarette or campfire lays waste to acres of woodland. Or, as in the
slow development of a forest, the growth of the trees themselves can change the
environment, the maturity of one species whose seedlings require sunlight contributing
to the growth of those better adapted to shade. If you should watch
an old abandoned pasture over a period of many years, you could see environment
gradually altered. First there are the mosses and grasses that create a
fertile soil. Then come the Poplars and shrubs. As these grow they offer shade
where Pines and, finally, the broad-leaved trees can flourish. This change in
vegetation will also bring about a change in the resident animal communities.</p>
<p>When parts of Castle Neck were rich farmland, specialized forms of life
which thrive in that type of environment were abundant there. We have only
to look at Castle Hill, just a few hundred yards from the dunes, or at some of
the swamps that dot the Neck to see how different are the inhabitants from those
of the dunes. On the Hill live the Oaks, Maples, Jumping Mice, Raccoons, and
Toads, plants and animals that would be misfits indeed&mdash;if they could live
at all&mdash;in the world of moving sand. Maples and Oaks, relics of the time when
the dune area was fertile, may still be found dying and being buried over by
drifting sand. Now it is a different community of plants and animals living here.
The continually shifting sand and the scarcity of water limit the variety of life
found, but each dune dweller is specially adapted to this homesite, and no
matter how lush, green, and more attractive a neighboring meadow may look
to us, many of these specialized organisms could not survive there at all.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>It has taken millions of years for the long, slow process of evolution to
develop specific adaptations that suit dune dwellers to their environment. There
are variations between individuals in every form of life. Mostly these are
normal inherited variations, such as height or color. But sometimes sudden
variations, called &ldquo;mutations,&rdquo; occur through accidental changes in the genes
controlling inheritance. These are new characteristics not found in other
members of the same species. If the mutation is advantageous it may be passed
on, and it is in this way that new life forms slowly develop. If the mutation
allows a species to live more easily in its environment, it may displace some
older form, which may then be unable to compete successfully for food, water,
or shelter.</p>
<p>Indeed, all life is engaged in a constant struggle for survival; it is those
individuals and species best able to adapt to the changing conditions of their
environment that endure. Think of the whole series of crises faced by any living
thing in its lifetime, then of these crises being met and overcome in the
seemingly inhospitable environment of the dunes. In the beginning, our dune
dweller must be born, a difficult enough task without interference from unkind
surroundings; it must feed itself, here in an area where meals would certainly
seem at a premium; it must grow, oftentimes shedding its skin in the process;
it must live not only in the summer&rsquo;s heat but, if its life span is that long, in the
winter&rsquo;s cold; it must endure long periods of drought, flood, wind, and storm;
and most important of all, it must survive long enough to reproduce its kind,
or else it has missed its goal. But such is the wonder of nature&rsquo;s specializations
that our dune dwellers can usually meet these normal crises. Their adaptability
and rate of reproduction safely insure the future of their kind, and their overpopulation,
if left to nature, is delicately controlled by available food and shelter
and their predators.</p>
<p>Exploring the dunes and making the acquaintance of the inhabitants, you
can see this environmental community meshing its lives together, and you can
observe the fine degree of adaptation developed by each life form. You may
find an occasional Apple tree growing out of the sand, rooted in a more fertile
soil below, a reminder of the time when that bit of the Neck was a rich farmland.
The roots of the Beach Plum also reach down to the water table, and it is
thus able to grow out of the sand, although its seedlings cannot take root in
the sand. Most of all, you will have an opportunity to note many special
animal and plant peculiarities the dune dwellers have developed to suit their
particular environment.</p>
<h3>SOME ANIMAL ADAPTATIONS</h3>
<h4><i>A Nest Deep Down in the Sand</i></h4>
<p>Walking through the dunes, you will frequently notice a small hole in the
sand. Poke a blade of grass into it and you will find the hole quite deep. As a
matter of fact, it may extend down two feet. This hole is made by the Sand
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
Dune Wolf Spider (<i>Lycosa pikei</i>) to provide a home where the female may raise
her young. Wolf Spiders are a species that elsewhere carry their young on the
back and hunt down their food wolf fashion, not even taking time to construct
a web. On the exposed dunes, the Sand Dune Wolf Spider protects its young
in this hole far beneath the ground.</p>
<h4><i>No Nest at All</i></h4>
<p>Dozens of Common Terns are to be found nesting at the southern tip of the
Neck. Long ago, the Common Tern began laying its eggs on the bare sand, and
made no nest at all. Each egg is sand-colored, with speckles resembling pebbles.
Only a patient search will locate a Tern nest on the Beach, and then, unless you
are cautious, the discovery may come after you have accidentally stepped on
the eggs.</p>
<h4><i>Eating What Comes to Hand</i></h4>
<p>Bayberries have a hard wax covering that makes them seem quite unpalatable
to us, compared to the more succulent berries found away from the dunes.
Yet here the Crows, Tree Swallows, and Myrtle Warblers are Bayberry-eaters.
The Myrtle Warbler in particular derives most of its winter diet from Bayberries.
In fact, its name comes from the scientific classification of the Bayberry,
which is in the Wax Myrtle Family.</p>
<h4><i>The Art of Being Inconspicuous</i></h4>
<p>The sand offers few places of retreat and few for hiding. It is not surprising,
then, that many of the living things here have a sand-colored protective coloration.
There is a large Grasshopper, or Locust, commonly found on the Beach.
Its dull, gray, speckled wing-covers make it practically invisible when at rest.
But the underwings, used for flight, are a striking orange with black bands.
When discovered, the Locust flies up, confusing its attacker with this bright
flash of color and a loud whirring noise. Unlike most insects, this Locust eats
the thick-skinned, dry Beach Grass.</p>
<h3>PLANT ADAPTATIONS</h3>
<p>Any plant that is adjusted to living in a region where there is a decided
lack of water is called a &ldquo;xerophyte.&rdquo; There are many different ways in which
plants have adapted their structure and way of life to the dune environment.
For instance, to reduce water evaporation they may have a very small leaf, to
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
offer less surface area to the sun; or smaller and more numerous stomata than
other plants (&ldquo;Stomata&rdquo; are tiny openings through which plants exchange
gasses. A pair of guard cells surround them and control the size of their opening);
or a very thick cuticle (waxy protective covering found on many plants);
or their sap may be changed chemically. Xerophytes may also be very fleshy,
like the cactus, to give more storage space for water. Their roots may drive
very deep into the ground to reach the water table, or they may be shallow and
spread out over a wide area to cover more surface. Their leaves may grow in
closely packed bundles to reduce further the surface area, or they may be very
thorny and prickly as a protection in exposed surroundings.</p>
<p>Here are just a few common examples of xerophytes and other plant adaptations
to be found at Crane&rsquo;s Beach.</p>
<h4><i>Anchor for the Dunes</i></h4>
<p>Beach Grass (<i>Ammophila breviligulata</i>) is a true xerophyte and has many
sand-dwelling characteristics. Its grasslike blade is rolled in at the sides, oftentimes
becoming a tube, in order to reduce the surface area. As you will probably
discover, it has a pointed tip that can prick a finger and, as you may well imagine,
acts as a deterrent to those who would eat or walk through it. Its underground
stems, in true xerophyte fashion, extend over a large area in an attempt to
gather all possible water, and these dense root-mats serve to anchor the dunes
and prevent their migration.</p>
<h4><i>A Tough Sand Dweller</i></h4>
<p>The Woolly Hudsonia (<i>Hudsonia tomentosa</i>) carpets the dunes, preferring
its place in full sun to more shaded spots. The tiny leaves are awl-shaped and
press very tightly against the stem, as though trying to hold in as much water
as possible. Hudsonia is covered with a velvet-like down, which is less susceptible
to evaporation than a smooth, large surface would be.</p>
<h4><i>An Adaptable Mushroom</i></h4>
<p>Since mushrooms generally require plenty of water, you would not expect
to find them at the beach. Several species, however, may be discovered here.
The most readily identifiable is the Earth Star (<i>Geaster hygrometricus</i>), which
resembles a Puff Ball but differs in having the outer layer of the skin divided
into tough, star-shaped segments. During the dry seasons, this star is drawn up
around the ball by its contraction, thus protecting it against further desiccation.
In wet weather, the ball swells and holds the star against the ground to allow
for water absorption. The &ldquo;roots&rdquo; of the Earth Star are shallow, so the plant
may readily be dislodged. The wind easily blows it across the dunes, spreading
the spores over a wide area.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<h3>NOW IT&rsquo;S UP TO YOU</h3>
<p>There is something new to be known about every animal and plant. Now
it&rsquo;s up to you! Careful observation will allow you to discover many other
examples of special adaptation to life in the shifting dunes, and the next chapters
will introduce you to some of the more common of the living things inhabiting
this strange sand-world. And if you wish to read more about ecology, try these

<br />PLANTS ON THE DUNES</h2>
<p>Plants add embellishment to the earth. For thousands of years people have
valued them for their elegance and their usefulness. They may rate no more
than a passing glance in fields and woods, but at the beach they stand out boldly,
for here they seem almost out of place.</p>
<p>We have already become acquainted with some strange beach-dwelling
plants; now let us examine more closely a few of the most common species.</p>
<h3>MUSHROOMS ON THE DUNES</h3>
<div class="species">
<div class="imgr" id="fig3">
<img src="images/p05.jpg" alt="" width="174" height="132" />
</div>
<dl class="species"><dt class="b">Earth Star</dt>
<dt>(<i>Geaster hygrometricus</i>)</dt></dl>
<dl class="species"><dt>Star-shaped fleshy skin at base</dt>
<dt>Main, central body is round</dt></dl>
<p>The flower-like shape of this common mushroom always
amazes its discoverer. The basal star is actually a protective
coat that covers the ball during dry spells. Its
scientific name, <i>Geaster</i>, means &ldquo;earth star.&rdquo; <i>Hygrometricus</i>
means &ldquo;water-measuring,&rdquo; and refers to the opening
and closing of the star.</p>
</div>
<h3>GRASS ON THE DUNES</h3>
<div class="species">
<div class="imgr" id="fig4">
<img src="images/p05b.jpg" alt="" width="217" height="329" />
</div>
<dl class="species"><dt class="b">Beach Grass</dt>
<dt>(<i>Ammophila breviligulata</i>)</dt></dl>
<dl class="species"><dt>Typical grass shape</dt>
<dt>Sharp, stiff tip to blade</dt></dl>
<p>Beach Grass is the most common xerophyte here. It
forms dense mats everywhere, and once it gains footing,
spreads at a remarkable rate. When windy weather bends
the blade it sometimes scribes circles in the sand. If these
are deeper on one side or incomplete, they help determine
the direction of the prevailing wind. Beach Grass can be
extremely uncomfortable to bare legs&mdash;so beware!</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<h3>FLOWERS OF THE SEASHORE</h3>
<p>Because of the great variety of leaf shapes and sizes, it is usually desirable
to have the flower for conclusive identification of seashore plants. As an aid, the
following species are listed by color.</p>
<h4><i>White Flowers</i></h4>
<div class="species">
<div class="imgr" id="fig5">
<img src="images/p05c.jpg" alt="" width="248" height="216" />
</div>
<dl class="species"><dt class="b">Blunt-leaved Sandwort</dt>
<dt>(<i>Arenaria lateriflora</i>)</dt></dl>
<dl class="species"><dt>Very thin stem and leaves</dt>
<dt>Flowers &frac14;&Prime; wide</dt></dl>
<p>This very attractive flower is seldom found at any distance
from water&rsquo;s edge. Usually it grows in the moist sand of
fresh-water pools, just above water level. On close examination
you will find the leaves quite hairy, almost downy.
The flowers are mounted at the tips of long stalks. They
appear early in the spring, about May, and blooming is
over by June.</p>
</div>
<div class="species">
<div class="imgr" id="fig6">
<img src="images/p05d.jpg" alt="" width="168" height="258" />
</div>
<dl class="species"><dt class="b">Sea Milkwort</dt>
<dt>(<i>Glaux maritima</i>)</dt></dl>
<dl class="species"><dt>Flowers are very small, at base of leaf</dt>
<dt>Thick central stalk</dt>
<dt>Leaves small, fleshy, and crowded</dt></dl>
<p>This is one of the most common beach plants, and is seldom
found away from salty soil. It grows in the salt marshes
and on the beach, starting its flowering in June and continuing
throughout the summer.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<h4><i>Red or Purple Flowers</i></h4>
<div class="species">
<div class="imgr" id="fig7">
<img src="images/p06.jpg" alt="" width="156" height="232" />
</div>
<dl class="species"><dt class="b">Beach Pea</dt>
<dt>(<i>Lathyrus japonicus</i>)</dt></dl>
<dl class="species"><dt>Flowers are in clusters</dt>
<dt>Branches end in twining tendrils</dt>
<dt>Leaflets small, toothless, and numerous</dt></dl>
<p>Anyone who has seen a garden pea will recognize the
Beach Pea, which is similar to but smaller than its cousin.
The purple flowers are seen from May throughout the
summer, and the peas are found in late summer. These
peas are edible, though not particularly delicious. You
will notice that Beach Pea stems are angular in cross
section&mdash;a further clue to identification.</p>
</div>
<div class="species">
<div class="imgr" id="fig8">
<img src="images/p06b.jpg" alt="" width="191" height="236" />
</div>
<dl class="species"><dt class="b">Beach Pinweed</dt>
<dt>(<i>Lechea maritima</i>)</dt></dl>
<dl class="species"><dt>Fruit very tiny, berry-like</dt>
<dt>Leaves tiny and narrow</dt></dl>
<p>Pinweed is a plant of sandy soils. Often it is found growing
alone on a patch of barren sand. It flowers throughout
July and August. Its stem is so very woody and tough
that it may easily be mistaken for a tiny, stunted tree.</p>
</div>
<div class="species">
<div class="imgr" id="fig9">
<img src="images/p06c.jpg" alt="" width="193" height="299" />
</div>
<dl class="species"><dt class="b">Sea Lavender</dt>
<dt>(<i>Limonium nashii</i>)</dt></dl>
<dl class="species"><dt>Large leaves, grow only from base of plant</dt>
<dt>Flowers numerous, small, on long stalks</dt></dl>
<p>The Sea Lavender goes by a great variety of names:
&ldquo;Beach Heather&rdquo; and &ldquo;Marsh Rosemary&rdquo; are the most
common. It is not a true dune dweller, for it is more often
found in marshy spots; but it is a typical seaside plant.
Its flowers are delicately fragrant. Amazingly enough,
you may find Sea Lavender completely submerged in salt
water during periods of high tide.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<h4><i>Yellow Flowers</i></h4>
<div class="species">
<div class="imgr" id="fig10">
<img src="images/p06d.jpg" alt="" width="132" height="217" />
</div>
<dl class="species"><dt class="b">Woolly Hudsonia</dt>
<dt>(<i>Hudsonia tomentosa</i>)</dt></dl>
<dl class="species"><dt>Tiny scale-like leaves</dt>
<dt>Very woolly, hairy</dt>
<dt>Almost mosslike appearance</dt></dl>
<p>The Hudsonia is sometimes called a &ldquo;False Heather&rdquo; and
surely reminds one of the moors. It is found in dense mats
on the dunes, and when in bloom covers the sand with a
bright yellow carpet. The flowers are borne in May and
June and open only in sunlight. Any attempt to uproot
the plant will merely break it off at the base, for the roots
are extremely long and spread over many square yards.</p>

<dl class="species"><dt>Leaves hairy, white, and velvety to the touch</dt>
<dt>Leaf with many fingerlike lobes</dt></dl>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to see its flowers to identify Dusty Miller.
Its heavy &ldquo;wool&rdquo; coat makes identification easy by feel
alone. The flowers form dense clusters during July and
August.</p>

<dt>Individual heads bushy</dt></dl>
<p>Everyone is familiar with Goldenrod, but few realize that
there are more than a hundred species, some of them very
specific as to where they live. The Seaside Goldenrod is
the only common species found on beaches or in marshes
with salty soil.</p>

<dl class="species"><dt>Large, ragged leaves</dt>
<dt>Covered with short, rough hairs</dt>
<dt>Heads are burrlike</dt></dl>
<p>The heads of this weedy plant, like those of the Burdock,
are covered with curved spines easily attaching to the fur
or clothing of passers-by. The burrs come late in the
summer, during August or September.</p>

<dt>(<i>Salicornia europaea</i>)</dt></dl>
<dl class="species"><dt>Plant is without leaves</dt>
<dt>Fleshy, jointed stems</dt></dl>
<p>Glasswort, a plant of the salt marsh, requires quantities
of salt water. It is easily identified by its leafless stem,
which looks like a string of sausages. In autumn these
succulent stems turn a bright red, adding an attractive
flash of color to the dying plants around them. Glasswort
stems take in great quantities of salt, which you will taste
if you chew one.</p>

<h3>SHRUBS AND TREES ON THE DUNES</h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p07c.jpg" alt="Sketch of tree-topped dune." width="498" height="158" />
</div>
<p>The shrubs and trees found on the dunes are those that grow well in sunlight
and can subsist on a small amount of water.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<h4><i>Shrubs of the Dunes</i></h4>
<div class="species">
<div class="imgr" id="fig15">
<img src="images/p07d.jpg" alt="" width="305" height="218" />
</div>
<dl class="species"><dt class="b">Bayberry</dt>
<dt>(<i>Myrica pensylvanica</i>)</dt></dl>
<dl class="species"><dt>Crush a leaf; note the sweet aromatic odor</dt>
<dt>Small, white, waxy berry in fall</dt></dl>
<p>No doubt the Bayberry is familiar to you. Wax from its
berries has long been used to make candles, and you may
wish to take some berries home to try your hand at this.
Boiling them will cause the wax to float on the water.
Dip a piece of string (wick) to collect it.</p>
<p><b>Sweet Gale</b> (<i>Myrica gale</i>) very closely resembles Bayberry
but has tiny pine-cone-like fruits instead of white berries.
It is very common in the swampy areas on the beach.</p>
</div>
<div class="species">
<div class="imgr" id="fig16">

<dt>(<i>Prunus maritima</i>)</dt></dl>
<dl class="species"><dt>Leaf with many small, sharp-pointed teeth</dt>
<dt>White flowers or purple fruit</dt></dl>
<p>This &ldquo;typical&rdquo; sea-beach shrub is well known. Its fruit
has long been used for &ldquo;Beach Plum preserve,&rdquo; a New
England favorite. The plums may be collected in late
summer. Beach Plum is reasonably common on the back
side of Crane&rsquo;s Beach, high on the dunes. It is often
twisted and gnarled from exposure to the winds.</p>
</div>

<dt>(<i>Rhus radicans</i>)</dt></dl>
<dl class="species"><dt>Three shiny leaflets</dt>
<dt>Small, white, waxy berries</dt>
<dt>Generally found twisting around another plant</dt></dl>
<p>One must admire Poison Ivy. It apparently can live
anywhere and survive anything. Beware&mdash;for it occurs
in patches on the beach. It is very poisonous to the touch,
and the best course is to wash thoroughly with a strong
soap if you come into contact with it. Some of the worst
cases of ivy poisoning may originate at the beach just
because people don&rsquo;t expect to find it here.</p>

<dl class="species"><dt>Leaves finely toothed</dt>
<dt>Twigs bitter when chewed</dt>
<dt>Black cherries in hanging clusters</dt></dl>
<p>Cherries are usually considered lovers of rich soils, but
this member of the family is quite common on the dunes.
It is always contorted here, and frequently diseased, but
still it survives. Generally it is found with large swellings
on the branches caused by the black cherry knot fungus,
since it is highly susceptible to this infection. The cherries
are edible, and you may or may not enjoy them. Try
one and see.</p>

<dl class="species"><dt>Broad, heart-shaped leaves</dt>
<dt>Stem of leaf is flat; leaf shakes easily</dt>
<dt>Smooth gray or yellow-green bark</dt></dl>
<p>The Aspen thrives in sunlight and dry soil. It grows and
dies quickly. It is called a &ldquo;Quaking&rdquo; Aspen because its
flattened leaf stems allow its leaves to shake even in the
gentlest breeze. It is often called a Poplar tree, or just
&ldquo;Popple.&rdquo;</p>

<dl class="species"><dt>Evergreen; with needles</dt>
<dt>Needles grouped in bunches of three</dt>
<dt>Pine cones under 3&Prime; in length</dt></dl>
<p>This picturesque pine grows well in sterile soil. It is
small, gnarled, contorted, and of little commercial value.
It serves a twofold purpose here&mdash;anchoring the soil and
supplying seeds for a great variety of birds and animals.</p>

<br />LIFE AT THE EDGE OF THE SEA</h2>
<p>Everyone likes to be a beachcomber! And each passing tide exposes the
secrets of the sea to those interested enough to take a closer look. Suppose that
we examine this world which is revealed to us twice daily.</p>
<h3>&ldquo;WEEDS&rdquo; OF THE SEA</h3>
<p>The sea holds many strange plants that have taken on fantastic sizes and
shapes because of their underwater environment. In spite of their size, these
plants are usually among the most primitive&mdash;a simple sheet of cells. Such
plants are called <i>algae</i> and are subdivided according to their colors.</p>
<h4><i>The Brown Algae</i></h4>
<div class="species">
<div class="imgr" id="fig21">
<img src="images/p09.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="358" />
</div>
<dl class="species"><dt class="b">Common Rockweed</dt>
<dt>(<i>Fucus</i>, several species)</dt></dl>
<dl class="species"><dt>Brown, flattened body</dt>
<dt>Central midrib</dt>
<dt>Stem has air bladders</dt></dl>
<p>The bladders are filled with air, and children like to squeeze
them to hear their pop. These bladders cause the plant
to float upright, thus keeping all its sides in contact with
water.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<div class="species">
<div class="imgr" id="fig22">

<dt>(<i>Ascophyllum nodosum</i>)</dt></dl>
<dl class="species"><dt>Thin, round stem</dt>
<dt>No central midrib</dt></dl>
<p>When dried by the sun, this plant makes an interesting
and lasting souvenir, for it turns a lustrous black.</p>
</div>
<div class="species">
<div class="imgr" id="fig23">
<img src="images/p10b.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="179" />

<dt>(<i>Laminaria agardhii</i>)</dt></dl>
<dl class="species"><dt>Broad, flat blade</dt>
<dt>Several feet in length</dt></dl>
<p>The kelps of the Pacific grow several hundred feet in
length, making them the largest of the algae and among
the very largest plants.</p>
</div>
<div class="species">
<div class="imgr" id="fig24">
<img src="images/p10c.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="221" />
</div>
<dl class="species"><dt class="b">Fingered Kelp</dt>
<dt>(<i>Laminaria digitata</i>)</dt></dl>
<dl class="species"><dt>Many blades, extending like fingers on a hand</dt></dl>
<p>All kelps have a rootlike structure called a &ldquo;holdfast&rdquo; to
serve as an anchor. Often tiny sea creatures dwell in
among the holdfast. Why not take a look?</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<div class="species">
<div class="imgr" id="fig25">
<img src="images/p10d.jpg" alt="" width="447" height="190" />
</div>
<dl class="species"><dt class="b">Perforated Kelp</dt>
<dt>(<i>Agarum cribrosum</i>)</dt></dl>
<dl class="species"><dt>Central midrib</dt>
<dt>Broad blade punctured with hundreds of holes</dt></dl>
<p>In Asia this kelp is farmed for food called agar. An
extract of the plant, agar-agar, is used in the laboratory
as a culture medium for bacteria and other disease-producing
organisms.</p>
</div>
<h4><i>The Green Algae</i></h4>
<div class="species">
<div class="imgr" id="fig26">
<img src="images/p10e.jpg" alt="" width="205" height="221" />
</div>
<dl class="species"><dt class="b">Sea Lettuce</dt>
<dt>(<i>Ulva species</i>)</dt></dl>
<dl class="species"><dt>A sheet of green</dt></dl>
<p>This is a very simple seaweed that reproduces itself by
fragmentation, each fragment growing into a new plant.
Two common kinds are found at Crane&rsquo;s Beach:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Ulva lactuca</i>, which is the broad green &ldquo;leaf&rdquo;; <i>Ulva
lanceolata</i>, which is in thinner, more ribbon-like strips.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<h4><i>The Red Algae</i></h4>
<div class="species">
<div class="imgr" id="fig27">
<img src="images/p10f.jpg" alt="" width="293" height="174" />
</div>
<dl class="species"><dt class="b">Irish Moss</dt>
<dt>(<i>Chondrus crispus</i>)</dt></dl>
<dl class="species"><dt>Flattened, branching fronds</dt>
<dt>Purple in life, white when sun-bleached</dt></dl>
<p>Here is a very common tidal plant that has commercial
value. It is called &ldquo;Dulse&rdquo; on the Boston markets, and a
very delicious pudding is prepared from it (seamoss
farine). Why not take some home and try it?</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<div class="species">
<div class="imgr" id="fig28">
<img src="images/p11.jpg" alt="" width="313" height="218" />
</div>
<dl class="species"><dt class="b">Polysiphonia</dt>
<dt>(<i>Polysiphonia</i>, several species)</dt></dl>
<dl class="species"><dt>Pink or red color</dt>
<dt>Branching, lace-like appearance</dt></dl>
<p>Sometimes called &ldquo;Mermaid&rsquo;s Hair,&rdquo; these tiny plants are
very common on the beach. There are many kinds of
Polysiphonias, but a microscopic study is usually necessary
to tell them apart.</p>
</div>
<div class="species">
<div class="imgr" id="fig29">
<img src="images/p11b.jpg" alt="" width="271" height="182" />
</div>
<dl class="species"><dt class="b">Coralline Algae</dt>
<dt>(<i>Coralline</i>, several species)</dt></dl>
<dl class="species"><dt>White or pink limy covering</dt>
<dt>Appear jointed</dt></dl>
<p>These plants have the amazing ability of concentrating
lime from the sea water and depositing it on their fronds,
thus acquiring a stony, coral-like appearance.</p>
<h3>ANIMALS OF THE SEA</h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p11c.jpg" alt="Dolphin" width="315" height="96" />
</div>
<p>Animals, in a kaleidoscope of unbelievable sizes, shapes, and colors, abound
here at the margin of the sea. Specializations range from the single-celled body
of the zooplankton to the multicellular body of the Seals and the occasional
Porpoise.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<h4><i>The Sponges</i></h4>
<div class="species">
<div class="imgr" id="fig30">
<img src="images/p11d.jpg" alt="" width="226" height="190" />
</div>
<dl class="species"><dt class="b">Finger Sponge</dt>
<dt>(<i>Chalina oculata</i>)</dt></dl>
<dl class="species"><dt>Brown or tan color</dt>
<dt>In colonies of fingerlike projections</dt></dl>
<p>The most common sponge on Crane&rsquo;s Beach is the Finger
Sponge. Even a small piece may be identified by the
holes on its surface, through which the animal filtered
water. The strange appearance of this sponge has given
it the repulsive name of &ldquo;Dead Men&rsquo;s Fingers.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="species">
<div class="imgr" id="fig31">
<img src="images/p11e.jpg" alt="" width="193" height="145" />
</div>
<dl class="species"><dt class="b">Crumb-of-Bread Sponge</dt>
<dt>(<i>Halichondria panicea</i>)</dt></dl>
<dl class="species"><dt>Pale green in life</dt>
<dt>Light tan or white when dried on beach</dt>
<dt>Crumbles easily</dt></dl>
<p>Only the most searching eye will discover this sponge,
because it so closely resembles a dull uninteresting rock
or pile of bread crumbs. When it has been freshly broken,
it has a vile odor&mdash;a good clue to identification.</p>
</div>
<h4><i>The Jelly-like Animals</i></h4>
<div class="species">
<div class="imgr" id="fig32">
<img src="images/p11f.jpg" alt="" width="267" height="115" />
</div>
<dl class="species"><dt class="b">White Jellyfish</dt>
<dt>(<i>Aurelia aurita</i>)</dt></dl>
<dl class="species"><dt>Flattened body</dt>
<dt>Under 10&Prime; in diameter</dt></dl>
<p>The tentacles dangling down from the underside of this
jellyfish are covered with tiny stinging cells, which in this
species do not penetrate human skin.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<div class="species">
<div class="imgr" id="fig33">
<img src="images/p12.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="192" />
</div>
<dl class="species"><dt class="b">Pink or Red Jellyfish</dt>
<dt>(<i>Cyanea capillata</i>)</dt></dl>
<dl class="species"><dt>More than 10&Prime; in diameter</dt>
<dt>Reddish center, yellowish sides</dt></dl>
<p>This jellyfish occasionally grows up to eight feet in diameter,
with tentacles a hundred or more feet long. The stinging
cells can painfully wound a swimmer, but you may
examine a small jellyfish safely by placing your hand on
the smooth dorsal surface and turning it over.</p>
</div>
<div class="species">
<div class="imgr" id="fig34">
<img src="images/p12b.jpg" alt="" width="261" height="216" />
</div>
<dl class="species"><dt class="b">Sea Anemone</dt>
<dt>(<i>Metridium dianthus</i>)</dt></dl>
<dl class="species"><dt>Cylindrical, soft body</dt>
<dt>Tentacles at top give flower-like appearance</dt>
<dt>Generally very colorful</dt></dl>
<p>The &ldquo;petals&rdquo; of the Sea Anemone&rsquo;s flower-like head are
actually tentacles covered with stinging cells and used to
stun its food. Generally found in the water at tide level,
the Sea Anemone moves by walking on its single, base-like
foot.</p>
</div>
<h4><i>The Worms</i></h4>
<div class="species">
<div class="imgr" id="fig35">
<img src="images/p12c.jpg" alt="" width="324" height="263" />
</div>
<dl class="species"><dt class="b">Clam Worm</dt>
<dt>(<i>Nereis virens</i>)</dt></dl>
<dl class="species"><dt>Jointed</dt>
<dt>One pair of paddle-like feet per segment</dt>
<dt>Two &ldquo;tails&rdquo;</dt>
<dt>Pinchers on the head (watch out!)</dt></dl>
<p>This is the best-known worm on the beach because of its
desirability as fish bait. During the day it lives in its
burrow in the sand, wandering forth at night and swimming
about in the water, where it becomes easy prey for
gulls and fishes. The skin is brilliantly iridescent in the
sunlight.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<h4><i>The Crustaceans</i></h4>
<div class="species">
<div class="imgr" id="fig36">
<img src="images/p12d.jpg" alt="" width="248" height="165" />
</div>

<dl class="species"><dt>Common on rocks and shellfish</dt>
<dt>White, volcano-shaped shell</dt>
<dt>Two &ldquo;barn doors&rdquo; at top</dt></dl>
<p>This animal goes through life standing on its head and
kicking food into its mouth with its feet! When it is submerged
in sea water you can see its shell doors open and
its feather-like feet sweep the water for microscopic food
organisms. The limy shell first suggests a relationship
with the clam, but body structure shows it to be a closer
relative of the crab.</p>

<p>Bits and pieces of Lobster are frequently found on the
beach, but seldom the entire animal. The Lobster inhabits
deeper water and finds its way to shore only after losing a
battle with one of its enemies. A favorable dining size is
one or two pounds; however, Lobsters do attain weights
up to forty pounds.</p>

<dl class="species"><dt>Football-shaped in cross section</dt>
<dt>Two large claws</dt>

<p>The three very common True Crabs of Crane&rsquo;s Beach may
be found in one search of the tidal pools. They are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Rock Crab</b> (<i>Cancer irroratus</i>): A brick-red shell, somewhat
granulated, with a black and yellowish undersurface.</p>
<p><b>Jonah Crab</b> (<i>Cancer borealis</i>): Similar in color to the above,
but its shell has a more sculptured surface.</p>
<p><b>Green Crab</b> (<i>Carcinides maenas</i>): A greenish-colored shell.
The last pair of legs end in sharp points, rather than being
flattened like paddles.</p>

<p>The Horseshoe is not a Crab at all, but is more closely
related to the spiders, mites, and scorpions. In spite of its
relations, the Horseshoe is a harmless creature whose only
protection is its hard shell. Therefore it may be examined
freely&mdash;a strange &ldquo;living fossil&rdquo; that has survived
400,000,000 years of evolution with very little change.</p>

<p>Living mussels are always found attached to rocks or
pieces of wood by tiny threads of their own making. Two
common mussels are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Edible Mussel</b> (<i>Mytilus edulis</i>): Smooth, velvety-blue shell
identifies it. The animal within is edible and quite delicious.
It is commonly utilized as food in Europe but less
so here, where we have, and seem to prefer, the Oyster.</p>
<p><b>Ribbed Mussel</b> (<i>Modiolus demissus plicatulus</i>): Similar to
the above but with many distinct ribs radiating on the
surface. The Ribbed Mussel is not considered edible.
While not poisonous, it is most unpalatable.</p>

<p><b>Periwinkles</b> (<i>Littorina</i>): These have a wrinkled shell about
the size of a thumbnail. Because they are able to withstand
long periods without water, Periwinkles are often
found high on a beach.</p>
<p><b>Rock Purple</b> (<i>Thais lapillus</i>): Has a rough, white shell
coming to a point at the top. This snail secretes a purplish
dye that was used by the American Indians and the
ancient Phoenicians to produce their &ldquo;royal purple&rdquo; dyes.</p>
<p><b>Moon Snail</b> (<i>Polinices heros</i>): Large white shell with

<dl class="species"><dt>Shell is boat-shaped</dt>
<dt>Tiny &ldquo;seat&rdquo; inside shell</dt></dl>
<p>This animal protects its bare underside by attaching itself

Starfish apart to destroy them, until they discovered that
each arm has the ability to regenerate and become a whole

<dl class="species"><dt>Silver-dollar size and shape</dt>
<dt>Raised, star-shaped pattern on back</dt></dl>
<p>This is an animal of deeper water and so the bather seldom
sees a live, heavily spined specimen. We find the dry,
spineless shells on the beach. Wrap them carefully if you
wish to take them home, because they are most fragile.</p>
</div>
<h4><i>The Fishes</i></h4>
<p>The waters off Crane&rsquo;s Beach abound with many dramatic fishes such as
Cod, Mackerel, Flounder, and Sand Sharks; but we are concerned only with the
common tidal fishes that are regularly washed onto the shore.</p>
<div class="species">
<div class="imgr" id="fig52">

<dt>(<i>Syngnathus fuscus</i>)</dt></dl>
<dl class="species"><dt>Lead-pencil size and shape</dt>
<dt>Hard, bony plates cover body</dt></dl>
<p>One look at a Pipefish will convince you that it must be
related to the Seahorse. It spawns late in the spring, the
female laying her eggs in the pouch on the stomach of the
male. The male carries these eggs kangaroo-fashion, until
they hatch during the summer.</p>

<dt>(<i>Menidia menidia</i>)</dt></dl>
<dl class="species"><dt>Silver stripe running down a light side</dt></dl>
<p>These fish are also an important food item for the Gulls
and Terns. Silversides run in schools of a hundred or
more, which can be located by the flocks of birds gathered
round overhead.</p>

<p>These are harmless fish resembling the dangerous Rays of
the tropics, except for their habits. The egg cases of the
Skate are rectangular, black, horny envelopes. They are
commonly found on the beach, where they are called
&ldquo;mermaids&rsquo; purses.&rdquo; If you find a fresh one and open it,
you may discover a miniature Skate inside.</p>

<br />INSECTS AND THEIR KIN</h2>
<p>The insect world populating the dense grass jungles and sand-dune deserts at
Castle Neck is generally unfamiliar to the human towering above, yet its principal
characters may readily be observed by the keen eye, or, better, the keen eye
aided by a simple magnifying glass.</p>
<p>Insects are identified by the presence of six legs. Insect-like animals may
be found with more than six legs. Let&rsquo;s look at these first.</p>
<h3>INSECT RELATIVES: MULTILEGGED CREATURES</h3>
<h4><i>Eight-legged Animals</i></h4>

<dl class="species"><dt>Body egg-shaped in outline</dt>
<dt>Very small head</dt>
<dt>Parasitic on human beings as well as animals</dt></dl>
<p>Ticks are quite common at the beach, but only the tourist
who ventures into the woods will encounter them. From
the tip of a blade of grass they hook on to a warm-blooded
animal passing by. In removing a Tick some care is
necessary so that the tiny head will not remain embedded
in the victim. Ticks can usually be persuaded to let go
if touched with a lighted cigarette or daubed with rubbing
alcohol.</p>

<dl class="species"><dt>Very small oval body</dt>
<dt>Extremely long, slender legs</dt></dl>
<p>Better known as &ldquo;Daddy-long-legs,&rdquo; these creatures resemble
Spiders, but are not very closely related to them.
They are perfectly harmless and cannot bite. Most of
them feed on plant juices or dead insects.</p>

<dt>(Araneida)</dt></dl>
<dl class="species"><dt>Body divided into two distinct parts</dt>
<dt>All have poison fangs</dt></dl>
<p>Many spiders are to be found on Crane&rsquo;s Beach. Most
are small, harmless, and difficult to identify. However,
some of the general groups may be readily recognized:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Sheet-web Spiders</b> (Linyphiidae): A small spider, usually
less than a quarter of an inch long. Its sheetlike web
identifies it.</p>
<p><b>Orb-weaving Spiders</b> (Argiopidae): All of these spiders
build their webs like a wheel with radiating spokes. The
<b>Orange-and-Black Garden Spider</b> (<i>Miranda aurantia</i>), a
large species infesting grassy places in the fall, is typical
of the group.</p>
<p><b>Crab Spiders</b> (Thomisidae): The Crab Spiders do not construct
webs, but their crablike shape and the fact that
they walk sidewise will identify them.</p>
<p><b>Wolf Spiders</b> (Lycosidae): This spider hunts its prey
instead of building a web and waiting for its meal to happen
along. Wolf Spiders are often large and quite hairy. The
holes you find in the sand dunes are nurseries constructed
by the female <b>Sand Dune Wolf Spider</b> (<i>Lycosa pikei</i>).</p>
<p><b>Jumping Spiders</b> (Attidae): &ldquo;Jumpers&rdquo; have a rather fat
body that is heavily covered with hair. They too hunt
their prey, often jumping several inches to capture it.</p>

<dl class="species"><dt>Elongated, segmented body</dt>
<dt>Fifteen or more pairs of legs</dt>
<dt>One pair of legs per segment</dt></dl>
<p>The Centipede is usually found hidden in a moist place.
It feeds on insects killed by a poison injected through its
jaw. Although Centipedes occasionally bite a finger, their
poison is so weak that the bite can be ignored.</p>

<p>The Millipede is found in much the same habitat as the
Centipede, under a board or rock or inside a rotten stump.
It is harmless, and lives for the most part on decaying
plants.</p>
<h3>INSECTS: SIX-LEGGED ANIMALS</h3>
</div>
<h4><i>The Mayflies</i></h4>
<div class="species">
<div class="imgr" id="fig64">
<img src="images/p17f.jpg" alt="" width="263" height="432" />
</div>
<p>These insects have long, soft bodies and two long
&ldquo;tails.&rdquo; The first stage in the Mayfly&rsquo;s life is spent under
water in one of the several swampy pools behind the main
beach. Early in the spring it changes into the winged adult
that is unable to eat. This adult lays its eggs and dies
soon afterwards.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<h4><i>The Dragonflies and Damselflies</i></h4>

<dl class="species"><dt>Two pairs of long, stiff wings</dt>
<dt>Two large compound eyes, which touch each other</dt>
<dt>Hold wings outspread when they alight</dt></dl>
<p>Dragonflies are often called &ldquo;Devil&rsquo;s Darning Needles,&rdquo;
but they are perfectly harmless. They frequent wet areas,
where they feed on other insects&mdash;particularly mosquitoes!</p>

<dt>Typical Grasshopper shape</dt></dl>
<p>Most Grasshoppers are strong fliers and are easily frightened
into flight. The males may be heard singing during
the day&mdash;a rasping noise produced by drawing the hind
leg across the veins on the wing.</p>

<p>The commonest Cricket here is the <b>Black Field Cricket</b>
(<i>Acheta assimilis</i>). The &ldquo;singing&rdquo; of the Cricket is produced
by the male as he rubs his wings together. Of
particular interest is the <b>Snowy Tree Cricket</b> (<i>Oecanthus
niveus</i>), which chirps rhythmically. By counting the
chirps in one minute and subtracting forty, then dividing
this total by four and adding your new sum to fifty, you
will have a rough estimate of the temperature in degrees
Fahrenheit.</p>

<p>Mantids were once rare in New England but in recent
years seem to have been extending their range northward
and are now quite common even in the grassy beach area.
They are said to be the only insects that can look over
their shoulders.</p>

<h4><i>The Earwigs</i></h4>
<div class="species">
<div class="imgr" id="fig70">

</div>
<dl class="species"><dt class="b">European Earwig</dt>
<dt>(<i>Forficula auricularia</i>)</dt></dl>
<dl class="species"><dt>Wings short, not half length of body</dt>
<dt>Two pincers on tail</dt></dl>
<p>The Earwig hides by day, coming out at night to feed on
plant material. Since it does not bite with its pincers, it
can be handled freely. Other species are occasionally
found. The <b>Seaside Earwig</b> (<i>Anisolabis maritima</i>) is the
largest New England earwig. It has more than twenty-four
segments to its antennae, whereas the European has
no more than fifteen.</p>

<h4><i>The True Bugs</i></h4>
<p>In common parlance, the term &ldquo;bug&rdquo; is usually applied to all insects.
Actually the following group is the only one scientifically recognized as &ldquo;bugs.&rdquo;
In all of them, half of the forewing is thickened and leather-like, and all of the
mouth parts are designed to pierce their food.</p>
<div class="species">
<div class="imgr" id="fig71">

</div>
<dl class="species"><dt class="b">Lygaeid Bugs</dt>
<dt>(Lygaeidae)</dt></dl>
<dl class="species"><dt>Four sections to antenna</dt>
<dt>Antennae end in club shape</dt>
<dt>Very few veins in forewing</dt></dl>
<p>The most common member of this group is the <b>Red-and-Black
Milkweed Bug</b> (<i>Oncopeltus fasciatus</i>), which feeds
exclusively on Milkweed. A small insect (<i>Geocoris</i>) also
belongs to this group. It has a hammer-shaped head and
may be found beneath dried seaweed.</p>
</div>
<div class="species">

<dl class="species"><dt class="b">Stink Bugs</dt>
<dt>(Pentatomidae)</dt></dl>
<dl class="species"><dt>Broad, shield-shaped insect</dt></dl>
<p>There are many kinds of Stink Bugs, so named because of
the disagreeable odor they emit when crushed. Some are
brightly colored and are commonly found on the fleshy
dune plants.</p>
</div>
<h4><i>The Aphids and Scale Insects</i></h4>
<div class="species">
<div class="imgr" id="fig73">
<img src="images/p19d.jpg" alt="" width="325" height="181" />
</div>
<dl class="species"><dt class="b">Woolly Alder Aphid</dt>
<dt>(<i>Prociphilus tessellatus</i>)</dt></dl>
<dl class="species"><dt>White, woolly mass on Alder or Maple tree</dt></dl>
<p>The Woolly Aphid is found only on Alder and Maple trees
and may be recognized by its downy appearance. Although
it feeds on the tree, it is never common enough to do any
damage. The wool is a secretion of wax protecting the
insect.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>

<dt>(<i>Lepidosaphes ulmi</i>)</dt></dl>
<dl class="species"><dt>Tiny oyster-shell-shaped body covering</dt>
<dt>Attached to bark of tree (particularly Poplar and Birch)</dt></dl>
<p>You must look very carefully to discover one of these
insects. The young Scales have legs and move about
during the month of June. Then they settle down, lose
their legs, and secrete a wax shell over their bodies. These
Scales are extremely common at the beach, but only the
careful observer is likely to see them.</p>

<dt>(<i>Chrysopa</i>, several species)</dt></dl>
<dl class="species"><dt>Delicate-green insect</dt>
<dt>Very large wings</dt>
<dt>Golden-colored eyes</dt></dl>
<p>In spite of its delicate shape, when caught the Lacewing
emits an odor which has earned it the name &ldquo;Stink Fly.&rdquo;
Its eggs are laid singly on long stalks because the young,
called &ldquo;aphid lions,&rdquo; are cannibalistic.</p>

<dl class="species"><dt>Body is soft but horny</dt>
<dt>Five segments in antennae</dt>
<dt>Usually found near dead animals</dt></dl>
<p>The Carrion Beetles lay their eggs on a dead animal,
which they bury as a food reserve for their young. This
habit has given them the common name of &ldquo;Burying
Beetles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The adult feeds savagely on other insects, killing them
with powerful jaws&mdash;which can also nip your finger. The
larvae are called &ldquo;doodlebugs&rdquo; and live in upright burrows
in the sand, allowing their jaws to extend above ground
to capture unsuspecting prey.</p>

<p>Click Beetles are so named because of the resounding
&ldquo;click&rdquo; they make when snapping up into the air after
being overturned. The adults are strict vegetarians, so
look for them on plants.</p>

<p>There are more than 1400 species in this group in the
United States and more than 30,000 in the world. Two
of the most common at the beach are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>May Beetle</b> (<i>Phyllophaga fusca</i>): A large cylindrical
brown body. Also called &ldquo;June Bug,&rdquo; in May and June
it is frequently discovered at night flying to a light.</p>
<p><b>Japanese Beetle</b> (<i>Popillia japonica</i>): The head and forebody
are metallic green; the wings are copper color. Introduced
from the Orient about fifty years ago, these beetles
do great damage to many kinds of plants.</p>

<dt>Long tube (snout) on head</dt></dl>
<p>These are very common beetles on the dunes. Their long
snout is used to drill into seeds and plant tissues. None of
our species do great harm, but they have some unpleasant
relatives&mdash;the <b>Plum Curculio</b> (<i>Conotrachelus nenuphar</i>)

<p>The Firefly&rsquo;s light is produced by the chemical reaction
of a substance called luciferin. It is an almost perfect
&ldquo;cold&rdquo; light, with practically no heat loss. The light is
used to attract the opposite sex during mating. The
larva of this beetle is the &ldquo;glowworm.&rdquo;</p>

rusty-red and black hairs. They are not beneficial.
Two common examples are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Salt-marsh Caterpillar</b> (<i>Estigmene acrea</i>): This caterpillar
is covered with rose-colored hair. It feeds on practically
every type of leaf in the fall.</p>
<p><b>Webworm</b> (<i>Hyphantria cunea</i>): It covers the ground for
several feet with its silky web. In large numbers, Webworms

<h4><i>The Two-winged Insects: Flies and Mosquitoes</i></h4>
<p>Flies differ from other insects in having only two wings (one pair). The

<blockquote>
<p><b>Carpenter Ant</b> (<i>Camponotus herculeanus pennsylvanicus</i>):
A large black ant that is found burrowing in damp wood.
The labyrinth-like tunnels in rotten wood will aid you in

of paper manufactured from wood pulp gathered by the
insect from dead trees or old fence posts. At the end of
the season, it may be as much as a foot or two in diameter.
The only safe time to collect these nests is during the
winter months!</p>

visitors to flowers. Their heavy body seems much too
bulky for flight. The bee makes its nest in old mouse
nests on the ground and a careful search for such nests
will generally result in discovery of a Bumblebee&rsquo;s home.</p>
<p><b>Honey Bee</b> (<i>Apis mellifera</i>): The well-known Honey Bee
was brought to this country from Europe. It has now
become a common &ldquo;wild&rdquo; bee as well as a domesticated
species. You may find some wild-bee colonies in hollow
trees, particularly on Castle Hill.</p>

<h3>INSECT COLLECTING&mdash;AN INEXPENSIVE HOBBY</h3>
<p>Insects are everywhere and it is easy to collect them. Practically no

<br />MEETING THE MAMMALS</h2>
<p>Mammals are defined simply as warm-blooded animals that have hair and
nourish their young on milk. They are considered the highest form of Earth
life. They are common everywhere, but their secretive habits make observation
difficult. You may consider yourself quite fortunate if you see even one or two
of the mammals living on Castle Neck during a single visit here.</p>
<p>In this chapter lengths given are measurements from the nose to tip of the tail.</p>
<h3>INSECT-EATING MAMMALS: SHREWS</h3>
<div class="species">
<div class="imgr" id="fig104">
<img src="images/p25.jpg" alt="" width="193" height="134" />
</div>
<dl class="species"><dt class="b">Short-tailed Shrew</dt>
<dt>(<i>Blarina brevicauda</i>)</dt></dl>
<dl class="species"><dt>Dark, slate-gray body</dt>
<dt>Length 4&Prime; or 5&Prime;</dt>
<dt>Tail about 1&Prime;</dt></dl>
<p>This little mammal is a creature of damp areas and is
generally associated with damp forests. It makes burrows
just under the surface of the ground. It is the <i>only</i> poisonous
mammal in the United States and uses its venom to
stun and kill its prey. However, the only result of a nip
on your finger will be considerable swelling. Because of
its insect-eating habit the Shrew is a most beneficial
animal.</p>
</div>
<div class="species">
<div class="imgr" id="fig105">
<img src="images/p25b.jpg" alt="" width="176" height="230" />
</div>
<dl class="species"><dt class="b">Cinereus Shrew</dt>
<dt>(<i>Sorex cinereus</i>)</dt></dl>
<dl class="species"><dt>Grayish-brown body</dt>
<dt>Length 3&Prime; to 4&Prime;</dt>
<dt>Tail more than 1&Prime;</dt></dl>
<p>This is the most common shrew on the Neck. It is found
roving about the salt marshes in search of insects. It
hunts during the day as well as at night, generally keeping
concealed under a grassy cover.</p>

<h3>WINGED MAMMALS: BATS</h3>
<p>Everyone can identify Bats. Their fingers are extended and joined with a
leathery membrane. Their ears are large to aid in catching the echo of their
voice as it is reflected from obstacles. They are most frequently seen at twilight
when they flitter over the dunes in quest of the many insects abounding there.
Bats have tremendous value because they eat such insect pests as mosquitoes
and flies.</p>
<p>We have five major kinds of Bats. They are not easily identified in flight.</p>

<h3>LONG-EARED JUMPERS: RABBITS</h3>
<div class="species">
<div class="imgr" id="fig112">
<img src="images/p26.jpg" alt="" width="239" height="220" />

<dl class="species"><dt class="b">New England Cottontail</dt>
<dt>(<i>Sylvilagus transitionalis</i>)</dt></dl>
<dl class="species"><dt>Large hind jumping legs</dt>
<dt>More than 1&prime; long</dt></dl>
<p>While the New England Cottontail is named for our area,
it does extend its range southward to mid-Alabama. It
may be separated from other species of Cottontails by a
narrow black spot between the ears. It is very common
on the Neck. These rabbits stay hidden most of the day,
venturing forth at night or early in the morning. Because
their diet is exclusively vegetable matter, we do not
consider them beneficial.</p>
</div>
<h3>BUCK-TOOTHED MAMMALS: RODENTS</h3>
<div class="species">
<div class="imgr" id="fig113">
<img src="images/p26a.jpg" alt="" width="252" height="214" />
</div>
<dl class="species"><dt class="b">Eastern Gray Squirrel</dt>
<dt>(<i>Sciurus carolinensis</i>)</dt></dl>
<dl class="species"><dt>About 18&Prime; long</dt>
<dt>Bushy tail, less than half the total length</dt>
<dt>Gray fur, white on underside</dt></dl>
<p>The Gray Squirrel easily adapts itself to any environment.
The large treetop nests constructed of <i>leaves</i> are made by
this squirrel. A brood of two to six young is raised once
or twice each spring.</p>
</div>
<div class="species">
<div class="imgr" id="fig114">
<img src="images/p26c.jpg" alt="" width="180" height="287" />
</div>
<dl class="species"><dt class="b">Red Squirrel</dt>
<dt>(<i>Tamiasciurus hudsonicus</i>)</dt></dl>
<dl class="species"><dt>About 14&Prime; long</dt>
<dt>Bushy tail, about half the total length</dt>
<dt>Rusty-red fur, underside white</dt></dl>
<p>This little squirrel will often be heard before it is seen,
scolding its terrestrial enemies with a loud clatter from a
perch high in a protective tree. In late spring its yearly
brood of four or five is raised in a nest of shredded bark
built high in a tree.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<div class="species">
<div class="imgr" id="fig115">

</div>
<dl class="species"><dt class="b">Eastern Chipmunk</dt>
<dt>(<i>Tamias striatus</i>)</dt></dl>
<dl class="species"><dt>8&Prime; or 10&Prime; long</dt>
<dt>Reddish-brown fur with two white stripes on back</dt>
<dt>White stripes on back are margined with black</dt></dl>
<p>The Chipmunk is a squirrel that keeps to the ground and
seldom climbs trees except to collect nuts. It packs the
nuts in two large cheek pouches, and when these are full
they look like a very bad case of mumps. The Chipmunk&rsquo;s
nest is found underground.</p>
</div>
<div class="species">
<div class="imgr" id="fig116">
<img src="images/p26e.jpg" alt="" width="234" height="253" />
</div>
<dl class="species"><dt class="b">Common Woodchuck</dt>
<dt>(<i>Marmota monax</i>)</dt></dl>
<dl class="species"><dt>Large, fat animal over 2&prime; long</dt>
<dt>Grayish- to reddish-brown fur</dt>
<dt>Bushy tail, 5&Prime; or 6&Prime; long</dt></dl>
<p>The Woodchuck has many common names; &ldquo;Chuck,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Marmot,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Ground Hog&rdquo; are the ones used in our
area. &ldquo;Chucks&rdquo; live in deep burrows underground and
there is always a great mound of earth in front of their
opening. Frequently the &ldquo;Chuck&rdquo; is seen standing
upright on its hind feet surveying its territory from the
top of this mound. The same tunnel probably has several
other more concealed openings which are used as escape
hatches. The Woodchuck hibernates far below the ground
during the winter months, and in the northern United
States never comes out on February 2, &ldquo;Ground Hog Day.&rdquo;</p>

<dl class="species"><dt class="b">Muskrat</dt>
<dt>(<i>Ondatra zibethica</i>)</dt></dl>
<dl class="species"><dt>Resembles a large rat</dt>
<dt>About 2&prime; long</dt>
<dt>Tail ratlike, flattened from side to side</dt></dl>
<p>The Muskrat is an aquatic mammal and is always found
in association with water. It is very common in the
marshy areas of the beach and may frequently be seen
swimming about in such spots. The Muskrat&rsquo;s fur has
become specialized for its aquatic existence and is water-proofed
with a heavy layer of oil. Muskrats feed extensively
on the marsh plants. In late fall they construct
large dome-shaped homes that protrude above the water.</p>

</div>
<dl class="species"><dt class="b">White-footed Mouse</dt>
<dt>(<i>Peromyscus leucopus</i>)</dt></dl>
<dl class="species"><dt>Feet and legs are white</dt>
<dt>Large eyes; prominent ears</dt></dl>
<p>These mice are common all over the Neck. They are
nocturnal and may be discovered in the daytime hiding
under boards that have washed onto the shore, or they
may be found in the wooded areas behind the main beach.
Their small nests are constructed out of fur and grass and
are located in depressions in the ground, frequently under
a board or log. When the original owners vacate these
nests they are often taken over by Bumblebees, Centipedes,
Earwigs, and other secretive creatures.</p>
</div>
<div class="species">
<div class="imgr" id="fig119">
<img src="images/p27b.jpg" alt="" width="192" height="233" />
</div>
<dl class="species"><dt class="b">Eastern Meadow Mouse</dt>
<dt>(<i>Microtus pennsylvanicus</i>)</dt></dl>
<dl class="species"><dt>Very small eyes</dt>
<dt>Tail short, about one-third total length</dt>
<dt>Brown fur, gray on underside</dt></dl>
<p>The Meadow Mouse is by far the most common mammal
of Castle Neck. Its burrows may be seen just under the
grass in all areas having ground cover. It feeds on many
of the trees in the area, chewing the bark around the base.
This girdling will eventually kill the tree. While this
habit makes Meadow Mice undesirable, they fortunately
prefer the smaller herbaceous plants when they are available.
Although common, Meadow Mice are seldom seen
because their days are spent running through their burrows.
These may extend over an area of many square
yards.</p>
</div>
<div class="species">
<div class="imgr" id="fig120">
<img src="images/p27c.jpg" alt="" width="427" height="194" />
</div>
<dl class="species"><dt class="b">Meadow Jumping Mouse</dt>
<dt>(<i>Zapus hudsonius</i>)</dt></dl>
<dl class="species"><dt>Tail longer than body, sparsely haired</dt>
<dt>White underside, olive-yellow back</dt></dl>
<p>Occasionally when one is walking in the grassy fields, a
Jumping Mouse will suddenly bound away in leaps averaging
three or four feet. If it is really frightened, these
leaps may carry the mouse as far as ten feet. In the
United States the Jumping Mouse is much more closely
related to the Porcupine than to true mice. Un-mouse-like,
it hibernates in an underground nest during the
winter months. Jumping Mice eat both insects and
plants.</p>

<h3>DOGLIKE MAMMALS: FOXES</h3>
<div class="species">
<div class="imgr" id="fig121">
<img src="images/p27d.jpg" alt="" width="347" height="244" />
</div>
<dl class="species"><dt class="b">Red Fox</dt>
<dt>(<i>Vulpes fulva</i>)</dt></dl>
<dl class="species"><dt>Looks like a long-legged dog</dt>
<dt>Reddish fur; feet and ears black</dt>
<dt>Large bushy tail, white on tip</dt></dl>
<p>Only the most fortunate observer will see a Fox, which is
most secretive and truly sly in its habits. It digs burrows
and produces four to nine young during April. The Fox
has been known to adapt its habits to changes humans
have made in its environment, and it is most beneficial
because it eats thousands of mice annually.</p>
</div>
<h3>RING-TAILED MAMMAL: RACCOON</h3>
<div class="species">
<div class="imgr" id="fig122">
<img src="images/p27e.jpg" alt="" width="205" height="217" />
</div>
<dl class="species"><dt class="b">Raccoon</dt>
<dt>(<i>Procyon lotor</i>)</dt></dl>
<dl class="species"><dt>Dense gray fur</dt>
<dt>Tail ringed with bands of black and white</dt>
<dt>Black &ldquo;mask&rdquo; over eyes</dt></dl>
<p>Raccoons are creatures of the night and seldom venture
forth in the daylight. They are expert climbers, spending
many hours high in a lofty perch, and if pursued they
usually seek refuge in a tree or swamp. They feed on
frogs, fish, eggs, insects, nuts, corn, and shellfish, which
they rinse carefully. The shellfish they skillfully remove
from their shells, and often small piles of shells are the
only clue to a Raccoon&rsquo;s presence.</p>
</div>
<h3>SCENT-PRODUCING MAMMALS: SKUNKS, MINK, WEASELS</h3>
<div class="species">
<div class="imgr" id="fig123">
<img src="images/p27f.jpg" alt="" width="239" height="293" />
</div>
<dl class="species"><dt class="b">Striped Skunk</dt>
<dt>(<i>Mephitis mephitis</i>)</dt></dl>
<dl class="species"><dt>Black fur with two white stripes on back</dt>
<dt>Large bushy tail, white at tip</dt></dl>
<p>The Skunk is an inoffensive creature that tries hard to
avoid people. Even when confronted, it is generally good-natured,
relying on its presence to discourage investigation
and employing its powerful scent only if pressed.
Skunks usually live in holes not far from water. These
holes have generally been taken over from another mammal
by &ldquo;squatter&rsquo;s rights.&rdquo; From four to seven youngsters
are born in late April and they follow their mother about
faithfully wherever she goes.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<div class="species">
<div class="imgr" id="fig124">
<img src="images/p28.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="221" />
</div>
<dl class="species"><dt class="b">Mink</dt>
<dt>(<i>Mustela vison</i>)</dt></dl>
<dl class="species"><dt>Elongated brown animal</dt>
<dt>Bushy tail, about 8&Prime; long</dt>
<dt>Toes are webbed</dt></dl>
<p>The Mink is extremely rare on the Neck and a careful and
thorough search is required to locate one. They are associated
with water and feed on shellfish and other aquatic
creatures. They are best known for their fur, a favorite
for coats. Fortunately, Mink are not common enough on
the Neck to warrant commercial trapping.</p>
</div>
<div class="species">
<div class="imgr" id="fig125">
<img src="images/p28b.jpg" alt="" width="189" height="128" />
</div>
<dl class="species"><dt class="b">Long-tailed Weasel</dt>
<dt>(<i>Mustela frenata</i>)</dt></dl>
<dl class="species"><dt>Long thin body; yellowish beneath, brown above</dt>
<dt>Tail long, about half the total length</dt></dl>
<p>The Weasel is a vicious, bloodthirsty animal that often
kills just for the sport of it. Most of its victims are mice
and insects, so its murderous instincts really benefit us.
Weasels hunt at all hours of the day or night and all year
round. Specimens in our area will occasionally turn pure
white in winter and become an &ldquo;Ermine.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<h3>HOOF-FOOTED MAMMALS: DEER</h3>
<div class="species">
<div class="imgr" id="fig126">
<img src="images/p28c.jpg" alt="" width="249" height="283" />
</div>
<dl class="species"><dt class="b">White-tailed Deer</dt>
<dt>(<i>Odocoileus virginianus</i>)</dt></dl>
<dl class="species"><dt>Tail held upright when alarmed</dt>
<dt>White patch on throat under chin</dt>
<dt>Ear lined with white</dt></dl>
<p>The White-tailed Deer is certainly the most obvious mammal
on the Neck and is readily seen if one will take a short
stroll in the wooded area behind the main beach or farther
out on the Neck. There are probably close to one hundred
deer here, a number approaching overpopulation. They
feed mostly on grasses and the more succulent plants.
Usually deer produce twins in early summer (June). The
fawns are light tan and spotted with white. Deer may be
seen readily in early evening when they come into the open
fields to browse. They seem to have become quite accustomed
to human observers and will frequently be as
interested in you as you are in them.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<h3>MAMMAL STUDY&mdash;A LIFETIME PROJECT</h3>
<p>Occasionally Whales, Seals, and Porpoises are sighted off the beach. These
are true aquatic mammals. We have only listed the mammals regularly found
living on the Neck. To see all of them is a summer&rsquo;s project, and to study their
life histories is equally exciting and challenging.</p>

<br />WINGS OVER THE SAND</h2>
<p>More than any other form of nature, birds invite the notice of the casual
naturalist. Their specializations, their plumage, and their song all serve as
attractive bait for our attention.</p>
<p>It is not surprising, then, that more books have been written about birds
than any other life form, and that many of these have been directed especially
to the layman.</p>
<p>Although more than 150 species of birds may appear during the course of
a year at Crane&rsquo;s Beach, only a small number will be described here in any detail.
Many of these will be summer birds that regularly nest on Castle Neck.</p>
<p>The common and scientific names of the birds listed below are in accordance with the
nomenclature in the latest edition (5th) of the American Ornithologists&rsquo; Union <i>Check-list</i>
(1957).</p>
<h3>BIRDS OF THE SEA</h3>
<div class="species">
<div class="imgr" id="fig127">
<img src="images/p29.jpg" alt="" width="269" height="330" />
</div>
<dl class="species"><dt class="b">Herring Gull</dt>
<dt>(<i>Larus argentatus</i>)</dt></dl>
<dl class="species"><dt>Body is pure white</dt>
<dt>Grayish-blue wings, tipped with black</dt>
<dt>Somewhat larger than a Crow</dt></dl>
<p>This is the familiar &ldquo;Sea Gull,&rdquo; one of many species so
called. Its value as a beach scavenger and &ldquo;garbage collector&rdquo;
has earned it protection by the federal government.
While preferring the rocky coasts of Maine for nesting, the
Herring Gull is by far the most familiar, if not the most
common bird found at Crane&rsquo;s Beach.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<div class="species">
<div class="imgr" id="fig128">
<img src="images/p29a.jpg" alt="" width="279" height="360" />
</div>
<dl class="species"><dt class="b">Great Black-backed Gull</dt>
<dt>(<i>Larus marinus</i>)</dt></dl>
<dl class="species"><dt>Much larger than Herring Gull</dt>
<dt>Wings are black on top surface</dt></dl>
<p>This beautiful gull, like its common cousin, is a scavenger.
It is larger and more antagonistic than the Herring Gull
and will often steal its food. In Maine, where both breed,
the Great Black-back frequently feeds on the Herring
Gull&rsquo;s eggs or nestlings.</p>
</div>
<div class="species">
<div class="imgr" id="fig129">
<img src="images/p29e.jpg" alt="" width="215" height="404" />
</div>
<dl class="species"><dt class="b">Common Tern</dt>
<dt>(<i>Sterna hirundo</i>)</dt></dl>
<dl class="species"><dt>Small, sleek, white body</dt>
<dt>Forked tail</dt>
<dt>Black crown on top of head</dt>
<dt>Orange-red bill</dt></dl>
<p>These delightful, graceful birds are again nesting at the
tip of the Neck. Their nest has been described earlier
(<a href="#Page_7">page 7</a>). Under government protection, their numbers
have been increasing rapidly. Keep a sharp watch and
you may spot an Arctic or Roseate Tern, both very similar
to the Common. It is entertaining to watch the Tern
fish. It hovers against the wind in one spot just off shore&mdash;then
suddenly drops into the water, only to reappear
again in a moment with some morsel of food. Repeated
again and again, this performance becomes a real show
which even the most uninterested sun bather cannot
ignore.</p>
</div>
<h3>BIRDS OF THE BEACH</h3>
<div class="species">
<div class="imgr" id="fig130">
<img src="images/p29f.jpg" alt="" width="216" height="262" />
</div>
<dl class="species"><dt class="b">Piping Plover</dt>
<dt>(<i>Charadrius melodus</i>)</dt></dl>
<dl class="species"><dt>Small, sandy-colored bird</dt>
<dt>Black neck ring and forehead markings</dt>
<dt>Voice: A clear, forlorn &ldquo;peep-lo&rdquo;</dt></dl>
<p>This rather rare shorebird so perfectly matches the dry
sand on which it hunts that it is often completely invisible
until it moves. If the sparsely lined nest is discovered,
the parents go into a &ldquo;broken wing&rdquo; act to draw attention
to themselves and away from their eggs or young. The
four light buff eggs marked with black are laid in May.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<h4><i>Five Common Migrants</i></h4>
<p>Although rare, the Piping Plover has been described in detail because it
does nest here. The following five birds are very common on the Neck during
much of the summer but do not nest on New England beaches.</p>
<div class="species">

<h3>BIRDS OF THE SWAMPY AREAS</h3>
<div class="species">
<div class="imgr" id="fig136">
<img src="images/p30f.jpg" alt="" width="260" height="245" />
</div>
<dl class="species"><dt class="b">Redwinged Blackbird</dt>
<dt>(<i>Agelaius phoeniceus</i>)</dt></dl>
<dl class="species"><dt>Male is black, with red shoulder patches</dt>
<dt>Female is a brown, uninteresting bird</dt></dl>
<p>The male Redwing is familiar to everyone. His beautiful
black plumage with red shoulder bars allows a rapid
identification. He is usually seen flitting about over a
marsh attempting to attract the attention of some admiring
female. The nest is built in a shrub on the marsh in
late May or June. Ordinarily it is well concealed, and
often the only indication of its existence is the loud scolding
of the anxious parents when intruders approach.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<div class="species">

</div>
<dl class="species"><dt class="b">Black Duck</dt>
<dt>(<i>Anas rubripes</i>)</dt></dl>
<dl class="species"><dt>In flight: A dark duck with silvery underwings</dt>
<dt>On water: Light brown with a yellow bill</dt>
<dt>Bright red feet</dt></dl>
<p>This heavily hunted waterfowl continues to breed even in
well-populated areas. Its nest is found here on the edges
of the many fresh-water pools that dot the Neck in association
with the swamps. About nine white or buff-colored
eggs are produced in May. After nesting, these ducks
may still be seen feeding on submerged plants. They
obtain their meal in a crazy &ldquo;dabbling&rdquo; fashion, standing
on their heads so that only the tail protrudes above the
surface.</p>
</div>
<div class="species">
<div class="imgr" id="fig138">
<img src="images/p31a.jpg" alt="" width="185" height="377" />
</div>
<dl class="species"><dt class="b">Black-crowned Night Heron</dt>
<dt>(<i>Nycticorax nycticorax</i>)</dt></dl>
<dl class="species"><dt>White breast, black on back and on crown of head</dt>
<dt>About Herring Gull size</dt>
<dt>Long, wading legs</dt></dl>
<p>Although most active at night, these herons may be seen
throughout the day resting or feeding. They wade about
in both the fresh and salt marshes in search of fish or
crustaceans, which they seize with their long bills. This
heron nests only rarely, if ever, on the Neck now, but
thirty years ago great rookeries were found here. These
birds are still to be found on the Neck in fair numbers
even though man&rsquo;s invasion of the area has reduced its
desirability as a nesting place.</p>
</div>
<div class="species">
<div class="imgr" id="fig139">

</div>
<dl class="species"><dt class="b">Marsh Hawk</dt>
<dt>(<i>Circus cyaneus</i>)</dt></dl>
<dl class="species"><dt>Males gray; females brown</dt>
<dt>Medium-sized hawk</dt>
<dt>Always with an obvious white rump</dt></dl>
<p>During the summer this handsome bird of prey is a familiar
sight soaring close to the ground over all large marshy
areas. In flight it holds its wings at an angle over its back,
rather than parallel to the ground as do most hawks. It
mates for life, bringing forth a brood of young once each
summer. The nest is quite un-hawk-like, located on the
ground and constructed of tall grasses. The Marsh Hawk
leaves the area and migrates southward sometime in early
September.</p>

<h3>BIRDS OF THE FIELDS AND WOODED AREAS</h3>
<div class="species">
<div class="imgr" id="fig140">
<img src="images/p31d.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="289" />
</div>
<dl class="species"><dt class="b">Rufous-sided Towhee</dt>
<dt>(<i>Pipilo erythrophthalmus</i>)</dt></dl>
<dl class="species"><dt>Underside white, orange on sides</dt>
<dt>Tail is long, dark, with white corners</dt>
<dt>About size and shape of a Robin</dt></dl>
<p>Towhees are more often heard than seen. Their loud
scratching noise in the underbrush frequently frightens
hikers. If disturbed, they will run on the ground to a
place of safety. Their song is very distinctive and has
been said to sound like &ldquo;Drink your tea&rdquo; with the <i>tea</i>
ending extended, or &ldquo;You and meeeee.&rdquo; The Towhee
generally breeds twice every summer, building its nest in
a small shrub or on the ground. This nest is usually as
difficult to discover as the bird itself.</p>
</div>
<div class="species">
<div class="imgr" id="fig141">
<img src="images/p31e.jpg" alt="" width="144" height="399" />
</div>
<dl class="species"><dt class="b">Tree Swallow</dt>
<dt>(<i>Iridoprocne bicolor</i>)</dt></dl>
<dl class="species"><dt>White throat and stomach</dt>
<dt>Blue-green back and head</dt>
<dt>Crescent-shaped wings, notched tail</dt></dl>
<p>Usually seen winging low over water, the Tree Swallow
serves to clean the air of water-loving insects. These
swallows appear on the Neck in great numbers during the
fall, when the scarcity of insects changes their diet to
Bayberries. Tree Swallows are among the last birds to
migrate in the fall and always the first to return the following
spring. Their nests are occasionally discovered in a
hollow tree during May or June, but these little birds will
readily accept a bird house in lieu of a hollow tree.</p>
</div>
<div class="species">
<div class="imgr" id="fig142">
<img src="images/p31f.jpg" alt="" width="290" height="400" />
</div>
<dl class="species"><dt class="b">Eastern Kingbird</dt>
<dt>(<i>Tyrannus tyrannus</i>)</dt></dl>
<dl class="species"><dt>Appears gray at a distance</dt>
<dt>Square black tail with conspicuous white tip</dt></dl>
<p>Infrequently, one sees a Hawk being attacked in flight by
a much smaller bird. This little ball of courage is likely
to be the Kingbird. Because of its swiftness in flight, the
Kingbird is an able fly catcher and feeds on flies regularly.
It builds a nest on the Neck, usually high in a tree, affording
it a good lookout post. Watch for this nest in June.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<div class="species">
<div class="imgr" id="fig143">
<img src="images/p32.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="291" />
</div>
<dl class="species"><dt class="b">Brown Thrasher</dt>
<dt>(<i>Toxostoma rufum</i>)</dt></dl>
<dl class="species"><dt>Brown bird with light breast covered with dark streaks</dt>
<dt>Long curved bill; very long tail</dt></dl>
<p>The Thrasher, and its cousin the Catbird, are both common
summer residents and nest on Castle Neck. The Thrasher&rsquo;s
loud song, often mimicking other birds, is distinctive
because every phrase occurs in pairs. When the nest is
approached, the song changes into a series of short clucking
noises, with an occasional hiss scolding the intruder.
Persistent investigation may uncover the well-constructed
nest on the ground. Look for this nest containing four
brown-marked blue eggs during late May or June.</p>
</div>
<div class="species">
<div class="imgr" id="fig144">
<img src="images/p32a.jpg" alt="" width="197" height="331" />
</div>
<dl class="species"><dt class="b">Mourning Dove</dt>
<dt>(<i>Zenaidura macroura</i>)</dt></dl>
<dl class="species"><dt>A slim, brown bird</dt>
<dt>Long pointed tail, bordered with white</dt></dl>
<p>This lovely, delicate dove occurs in every state of the
Union. The waste areas on the Neck are especially suited
to it because its main foodstuff is Pitch Pine seeds, weeds,
and grasses. The Mourning Dove&rsquo;s nest, placed in a
Pitch Pine, is so carelessly made that it is apt to be mistaken
for an old nest which is falling apart. Why it
doesn&rsquo;t do just this during the nesting season is a marvel.
This beautiful dove is sometimes mistaken for its extinct
cousin the Passenger Pigeon.</p>
</div>
<div class="species">
<div class="imgr" id="fig145">
<img src="images/p32b.jpg" alt="" width="178" height="293" />
</div>
<dl class="species"><dt class="b">Sparrow Hawk</dt>
<dt>(<i>Falco sparverius</i>)</dt></dl>
<dl class="species"><dt>Long pointed wings and long tail</dt>
<dt>Our only small hawk with a black-banded rufous tail</dt></dl>
<p>In recent years this colorful hawk has become quite a city
dweller, having little fear of humans. During May, four
or five eggs are laid in a deserted Woodpecker&rsquo;s hole or any
convenient cavity. As one would guess from its size, the
Sparrow Hawk feeds mainly on insects and seldom on a
mouse or sparrow. It is often seen hovering over a field
in search of prey or just surveying its feeding territory
from a high vantage point.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<div class="species">

</div>
<dl class="species"><dt class="b">Great Horned Owl</dt>
<dt>(<i>Bubo virginianus</i>)</dt></dl>
<dl class="species"><dt>Only large owl with ear tufts</dt>
<dt>Gray appearance, with white throat patch</dt>
<dt>Voice: Deep, penetrating &ldquo;Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo&rdquo; (usually an odd number of hoo&rsquo;s)</dt></dl>
<p>One or two of these magnificent birds can generally be
found on any thorough search of the Neck. They hunt
the Neck by night, taking a great toll of mice and other
small animals. The Great Horned Owl nests earlier than
any other New England bird, usually in February or
March. So early, in fact, it occasionally returns from a
hunt to find its nest and eggs covered with snow. A Great
Horned can often be located during the day by following
the sound of a noisy flock of Crows. These birds spend
hours screaming and scolding Owls whenever they find one
sleeping during the day.</p>
</div>
<div class="species">
<div class="imgr" id="fig147">
<img src="images/p32f.jpg" alt="" width="232" height="217" />

<dl class="species"><dt class="b">Yellow Warbler</dt>
<dt>(<i>Dendroica petechia</i>)</dt></dl>
<dl class="species"><dt>Only tiny <i>all</i>-yellow bird here</dt>
<dt>Reddish streaks on breast of males</dt></dl>
<p>On first discovery, this warbler is likely to be identified
as an escaped canary. Indeed, it is oftentimes called the
&ldquo;Wild Canary.&rdquo; It has a very charming, persistent song,
which it sings during most of the day. It builds a tiny
nest lined with down in the fork of a shrub. Unfortunately,
the Yellow Warbler arrives late in the spring and leaves
us early in the fall.</p>
</div>
<div class="species">

<dt>(<i>Geothlypis trichas</i>)</dt></dl>
<dl class="species"><dt>Male: All yellow, with a black mask over eyes</dt>
<dt>Female: Drab olive color with bright yellow throat</dt></dl>
<p>A very familiar bird on Castle Neck, the Yellowthroat
constantly makes its presence known by a bright &ldquo;witchity-witchity&rdquo;
song, sounding as though it is asking &ldquo;What-cha-see?&rdquo;
Its nest is built on or close to the ground and
is a rather bulky affair, much larger than seems necessary
for so small a bird. As with most of the warblers, the
Yellowthroat&rsquo;s diet consists entirely of insects&mdash;a characteristic
that makes it a most valuable guest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<h3>SOME WINTER SPECIALTIES</h3>
<p>A few tourists visit the beach during the winter. It is generally considered
to be a &ldquo;dead&rdquo; time of year. Yet the birds abound here, and many may be
found only during the cold months. Five examples are:</p>
</div>
<div class="species">
<div class="imgr" id="fig149">
<img src="images/p33.jpg" alt="" width="187" height="229" />
</div>
<dl class="species"><dt class="b">Common Loon</dt>
<dt>(<i>Gavia immer</i>)</dt></dl>
<dl class="species"><dt>Large, almost Goose size</dt>
<dt>Long, straight bill</dt>
<dt>Winter: Dark gray back, whitish throat and breast</dt></dl>
<p>All summer long the Loon lives in the quiet of some hidden
northern lake, but in the winter it moves out into the
ocean. The winter seas are cold and savage, and yet the
Loon takes them in stride. It is a powerful swimmer and
can dive easily and deeply. The voice of the Loon, heard
only in summer, is very distinctive; the loud, &ldquo;crazy&rdquo;
laughing call is responsible for the saying &ldquo;As crazy as a
loon.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="species">
<div class="imgr" id="fig150">
<img src="images/p33b.jpg" alt="" width="144" height="157" />
</div>
<dl class="species"><dt class="b">Horned Grebe</dt>
<dt>(<i>Podiceps auritus</i>)</dt></dl>
<dl class="species"><dt>Resembles a duck but has slender neck and pointed bill</dt>
<dt>Winter: Dark gray back, line down neck, and top of head; white on breast, front of neck, and underside of head</dt></dl>
<p>The Horned Grebe spends most of its time on the water,
frequently even sleeping there. It has also learned to
preen itself in water by rolling over on its side. Grebes
swim and dive actively, catching many small fish and
crustaceans. When frightened into flight they will run
many yards across the surface of the water before finally
hurtling into the air.</p>
</div>
<div class="species">
<div class="imgr" id="fig151">
<img src="images/p33c.jpg" alt="" width="194" height="293" />
</div>
<dl class="species"><dt class="b">Snowy Owl</dt>
<dt>(<i>Nyctea scandiaca</i>)</dt></dl>
<dl class="species"><dt>Very large white owl</dt>
<dt>A round, smooth head</dt></dl>
<p>The Snowy is a day-flying owl and therefore may be seen
perched high on a sand dune looking around for mice. Its
home is in the Arctic tundra, where it feeds on Lemmings.
When these are scarce during the winter, the Snowy
migrates southward to new feeding grounds. Because it
is not used to humans, you can often get quite close to this
owl before it will be frightened into flight.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<div class="species">
<div class="imgr" id="fig152">

</div>
<dl class="species"><dt class="b">Snow Bunting</dt>
<dt>(<i>Plectrophenax nivalis</i>)</dt></dl>
<dl class="species"><dt>About size of Song Sparrow</dt>
<dt>White body, rusty on head and back</dt>
<dt>Long, pointed, white wings with black tips</dt></dl>
<p>From its breeding grounds in the Arctic, this large sparrow-like
bird comes to Crane&rsquo;s Beach only in the winter. It is
at home during the hardest, most severe snowstorms. One
may stand on the verge of frostbite and watch large flocks
of Snow Buntings flitting about, whistling in a cheerful
tinkling song. Look for them among the dunes or marshes,
where they feed on the grass and weed seeds.</p>
</div>
<div class="species">

</div>
<dl class="species"><dt class="b">Ipswich Sparrow</dt>
<dt>(<i>Passerculus princeps</i>)</dt></dl>
<dl class="species"><dt>Large sparrow, gray above, white below</dt>
<dt>Breast and sides have dull brown markings</dt>
<dt>Upper parts more heavily streaked</dt></dl>
<p>The Ipswich Sparrow is an occasional visitor to Ipswich.
It was isolated years ago on desolate Sable Island off the
coast of Nova Scotia. It breeds only on Sable Island, but
its winter migrations cause it to wander along the Atlantic
Coast. It was first reported in 1868 from the dunes on
Castle Hill, hence its name Ipswich Sparrow. When
observed, this bird is most often found among the debris
left at high tide on the upper beach. It is quick to fly when
disturbed and, upon landing, will run for several yards to
lose itself in the Beach Grass.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
